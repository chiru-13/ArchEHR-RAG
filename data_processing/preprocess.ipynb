On ERCP the previous\\nbiliary stent was noted to be acutely obstructed by biliary\\nsludge and stones. As the patient's INR was normalized to 1.2, a\\nsphincterotomy was safely performed, with removal of several\\nbiliary stones in addition to the common bile duct stent.

He was \\nevaluated by neurology, who formulated the following A/P:\\n___ right-handed male with Crohn's Disease on Prednisone\\nand Humera who was transferred from ___ for further\\nevaluation of a pulmonary contusion after a restrained MVC.  The\\nexact sequence of events leading up to the car accident are\\ndifficult to verify given the pt's retrograde amnesia and that\\nthe pt's grandmother was sleeping in the car until she heard a\\nloud \\\"bang\\\" just prior to the car leaving the road and crashing\\ninto the tree.  The pt is currently asymptomatic save some neck\\ntension suggestive of a neck strain possibly secondary to whip\\nlash, but he does not have any scalp hematoma nor any focal\\nfeatures on exam.  His attention, memory and cognitive exam are\\nnormal and does not have any asymmetries on exam.\\n\\nCV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular \\nstandpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.\\n\\nPulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary \\nstandpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. \\n\\nGI/GU/FEN: The patient tolerated well a regular diet, he did not \\nsuffer abdominal pain, nausea or vomit during this admission. \\nPatient's intake and output were closely monitored\\n\\nOccupational therapy evaluated the patient, he passed TBI \\nscreen, no concerns from OT standpoint, no services needed. OT \\nagrees with discharge when medically cleared. \\n\\nAt the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile \\nand hemodynamically stable.  The patient was tolerating a diet, \\nambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well \\ncontrolled.  The patient received discharge teaching and \\nfollow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and \\nagreement with the discharge plan.\\n\\nDischarge Instructions:\\n \\n* Take deep breaths as often as possible. This will help expand \\nthe small airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up \\nsecretions that sometimes pool in the lungs. \\n\\n \\n* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you \\nshould take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid \\nand fiber intake if possible.\",\n          \"Brief Hospital Course:\\n\\nACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:\\n# Chronic Abdominal pain with flare of nausea/vomiting:\\nPatient with several year history of episodic severe epigastric \\nabdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting with prior gastrointestinal \\nevaluation unrevealing. The patient has had an abnormal gastric \\nemptying study in the past, but most recently on ___ her \\ngastric emptying was normal. Prior abdominal imaging with \\npancreatic divisum but no evidence of chronic pancreatitis. She \\ncomplained of two distinct types of back pain, upper back pain \\nthought possibly related to abdominal pain but unclear. Saw \\noutpatient gastroenterologist on the day of presentation, who \\nscheduled EUS to rule out pancreatic cause. Consulted advanced \\nendoscopy team, and they felt that pancreas divisum would not be \\na likely cause of her pain. She had an unremarkable CT A/P with \\ncontrast and EUS which was unrevealing for a cause of abdominal \\npain, but did note fatty pancreas. Results discussed with \\noutpatient GI provider, who felt her abdominal pain at this \\npoint may be referred or radiating from the spine and \\nrecommended outpatient pain consult and followup as scheduled. \\nShe initially required IV dilaudid and PO oxycodone for pain \\ncontrol, and says she takes oxycodone rarely at home for pain \\nflares. Received IV -> PO antiemetics. She had no episodes of \\nemesis. Pain and nausea improved and she was able to tolerate PO \\nby discharge. She was started on IV Famotidine, which was \\ntransitioned to PO and continued on discharge, though she had no \\nevidence of esophagitis/gastritis on EUS so this can probably be \\nquickly discontinued if no apparent benefit. Ultimately still \\nunclear why she is having such severe abdominal pain.\\n\\n# Chronic Mid back pain:\\nShe noted crampy bilateral mid-back pain which seemed to flare \\nboth with and without abdominal pain. Patient reports massaging \\nher back for hours at home with some improvement. This pain \\nseemed more consistent with muscle spasm and did not seem \\nnecessarily related to her abdominal pain. Trialed increased \\nfrequency of home flexeril with unclear benefit so resumed home \\ndosing on discharge. Trialed lidocaine patch. If this is MSK \\ntype pain, weight loss may help, this was discussed with \\npatient.\\n\\nCHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS:\\n# ADD: Held Adderall, resumed on discharge\\n\\n# Anxiety: Held clonazepam, resumed on house\\n\\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\\n===================\\n[] reevalute need for famotidine at followup and stop if not \\nhelping\\n[] rx short course of oxycodone for continued pain control\\n[] started standing acetaminophen for pain, if continuing longer \\nthan a few weeks, please monitor LFTs and renal function\\n[] recommended outpatient pain consult and integrative medicine \\nconsult at ___, both discussed with patient and she is \\nagreeable\\n[] referral for outpatient ___ provided\\n[] could consider starting gabapentin if not already trialed\\n\\nDischarge Instructions:\\n\\nYou also had a lot of back pain. You had pictures taken of your \\nback. You should see a physical therapist as an outpatient. You \\nshould also go to the pain clinic.\\n\\nYou can take the oxycodone for a short time and follow up with \\nDr. ___.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"patient_question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"note_excerpt_sentences\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Frank pus was noted to be draining\\nfrom the common bile duct, and post-ERCP it was recommended that\\nthe patient remain on IV Zosyn for at least a week. The\\nVancomycin was discontinued.\\n\\nOn hospital day 4 (post-procedure day 3) the patient returned to\\nERCP for re-evaluation of her biliary stent as her LFTs and\\nbilirubin continued an upward trend. On ERCP the previous\\nbiliary stent was noted to be acutely obstructed by biliary\\nsludge and stones. As the patient's INR was normalized to 1.2, a\\nsphincterotomy was safely performed, with removal of several\\nbiliary stones in addition to the common bile duct stent.

He was \\nevaluated by neurology, who formulated the following A/P:\\n___ right-handed male with Crohn's Disease on Prednisone\\nand Humera who was transferred from ___ for further\\nevaluation of a pulmonary contusion after a restrained MVC.  The\\nexact sequence of events leading up to the car accident are\\ndifficult to verify given the pt's retrograde amnesia and that\\nthe pt's grandmother was sleeping in the car until she heard a\\nloud \\\"bang\\\" just prior to the car leaving the road and crashing\\ninto the tree.

His attention, memory and cognitive exam are\\nnormal and does not have any asymmetries on exam.\\n\\nCV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular \\nstandpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.\\n\\nPulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary \\nstandpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. \\n\\nGI/GU/FEN: The patient tolerated well a regular diet, he did not \\nsuffer abdominal pain, nausea or vomit during this admission. \\nPatient's intake and output were closely monitored\\n\\nOccupational therapy evaluated the patient, he passed TBI \\nscreen, no concerns from OT standpoint, no services needed.

The patient has had an abnormal gastric \\nemptying study in the past, but most recently on ___ her \\ngastric emptying was normal. Prior abdominal imaging with \\npancreatic divisum but no evidence of chronic pancreatitis. She \\ncomplained of two distinct types of back pain, upper back pain \\nthought possibly related to abdominal pain but unclear. Saw \\noutpatient gastroenterologist on the day of presentation, who \\nscheduled EUS to rule out pancreatic cause. Consulted advanced \\nendoscopy team, and they felt that pancreas divisum would not be \\na likely cause of her pain. She had an unremarkable CT A/P with \\ncontrast and EUS which was unrevealing for a cause of abdominal \\npain, but did note fatty pancreas. Results discussed with \\noutpatient GI provider, who felt her abdominal pain at this \\npoint may be referred or radiating from the spine and \\nrecommended outpatient pain consult and followup as scheduled. \\nShe initially required IV dilaudid and PO oxycodone for pain \\ncontrol, and says she takes oxycodone rarely at home for pain \\nflares. Received IV -> PO antiemetics. She had no episodes of \\nemesis. Pain and nausea improved and she was able to tolerate PO \\nby discharge. She was started on IV Famotidine, which was \\ntransitioned to PO and continued on discharge, though she had no \\nevidence of esophagitis/gastritis on EUS so this can probably be \\nquickly discontinued if no apparent benefit. Ultimately still \\nunclear why she is having such severe abdominal pain.\\n\\n# Chronic Mid back pain:\\nShe noted crampy bilateral mid-back pain which seemed to flare \\nboth with and without abdominal pain. Patient reports massaging \\nher back for hours at home with some improvement. This pain \\nseemed more consistent with muscle spasm and did not seem \\nnecessarily related to her abdominal pain.
