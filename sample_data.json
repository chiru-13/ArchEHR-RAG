He presented with recurrent headaches, dizziness, and occasional episodes of blurry vision over the past two months. His blood pressure at the clinic visit was 162/98 mmHg. He was previously on amlodipine but stopped taking it due to leg swelling. The patient is concerned about alternative treatments and whether lifestyle changes alone could manage his condition.",
        "clinician_question": "What are the potential alternative medications for this patient’s hypertension, considering his history of leg swelling with amlodipine, and how do they compare in terms of efficacy and side effects?",
        "note_excerpt": "Medical Assessment:\n\nThe patient has stage 2 hypertension with elevated blood pressure readings. Given intolerance to amlodipine, options include switching to an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or a beta-blocker. Lifestyle modifications such as reduced sodium intake and increased physical activity were recommended. A follow-up in two weeks was scheduled to reassess blood pressure response to the new treatment.",

She has a history of heavy menstrual periods and follows a vegetarian diet. Bloodwork revealed hemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL and ferritin levels of 10 ng/mL. The primary care physician diagnosed iron-deficiency anemia and prescribed oral ferrous sulfate. However, the patient is unsure if her symptoms are solely due to anemia and wants to explore other possible causes.",

Given her history of heavy menstrual bleeding, further evaluation for underlying gynecological conditions is warranted. She was prescribed oral iron therapy and advised to return for repeat labs in one month.",
